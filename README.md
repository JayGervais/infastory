PHP/MySQL project by Jay Gervais

This social media website was designed with PHP, MySQL and object oriented programming as a way to explore techniques and improve upon my coding skills. This website includes features such as posting text and images, creating galleries, commenting on posts, searching and adding friends, and more. The start of this project is based on the Udemy Course, 'Build a Social Network from Scratch: JavaScript, PHP + MySQL' by Reece Kenny.
